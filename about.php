                                I set up as a coach because I like to help people, and I believe in the power of positive influence. I set about chasing down every bit of knowledge and chunk of information I could get my hands in the realm of nutrition, food, health, physiology and psychology, all in an attempt to get a deeper fundamental understanding of how every aspect of peoples lives interact with one another.
                            <p  class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".7s" data-wow-duration="500ms">
                                I want to help revolutionize how people think and feel about food, and dispel some myths at the same time. I want to do all of this with evidence based, science backed advice. I personally see knowledge as my unique selling point, which I want to share with the world one person at a time.</p>
                                <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".7s" data-wow-duration="500ms">I work together with my clients to break down barriers, identify obstacles and build the framework for you to go ahead and do all the small and the big things that you need to do, but donâ€™t, to get to where they want to go. Success for me working with a client is you becoming successful with your own goals.</p>
